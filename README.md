# Hi! 
## My name is Yaroslav. 
I am 20 years old. I am studing in Ivan Franko National University of Lviv.\
I found a lot of buddies and it`s cool. Also I like hiking and riding a bicycling.\
I finished two weeks in coursera and all of the tasks in  learngitbranching.js.\
I learned **HTML5** & **CSS3** before this course, also I started to learn **JS**. I used Git at univercity.\
https://learngitbranching.js.org/ - It is a reaaly good game for students. Last tasks was a bit difficult, but it is okay.\
[Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) - It was really nice, I like this course, I listened in English with subtitles.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
[Module 1](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/Quiz_1.jpg)\
[Module 2](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/Quiz_2.jpg)\
[Module 3](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/Quiz_3.jpg)\
[Module 4](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/Quiz_4.jpg)\
Linux was new for me at all. It was interesting and I made notes. I was surprise that hard disks are connect to themself (it is not like Windows). \
Also every quiz were cool. I think I will use Linux in future, I like it.\
Articles about HTTP were very interesting too. I knew about difference between HTTP & HTTPS, but I didn't know such a lot information.\
Thank you for this!

## Git collaboration
[Week 3](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/Week%20%E2%84%963.png)\
[Week 4](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/Week%20%E2%84%964.png)\
As for me, all of the information was new. As usual, I made notes. I was surprised by the different ways of resolving conflicts (Week 3). I think I will use it in future, on my future projects with the team

## Intro to HTML and CSS
[Week 1](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/Intro%20HTML5.jpg)\
[Week 2](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/Intro%20CSS3.jpg)\
[Learn HTML](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/Learn%20HTML.jpg)\
[Learn CSS](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/Learn%20CSS.jpg)\
I know everything during these tasks because I have studied HTML & CSS before. I was surprised by CodeAcademy. I didn't know that platform at all. In the future, I will use all my knowledge from this course.

## Responsive Web Design
[Flexbox froggy](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/flexboxFroggy.jpg)\
[Grid garden](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/gridGarden.jpg)\
As for me, the grid layout was new. I have never worked with it, i think flexbox is more useful than grid.\
So it was interesting, but I hope I will almost work with flexbox
