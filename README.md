# Hi! 
## My name is Yaroslav. 
I am 20 years old. I am studing in Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. 
I found a lot of buddies and it`s cool. Also I like hiking and riding a bicycling. 
I finished two weeks in coursera and all of the tasks in  learngitbranching.js.
I learned **HTML5** & **CSS3** before this course, also I started to learn **JS**. I used Git at univercity.
https://learngitbranching.js.org/ - It is a reaaly good game for students. Last tasks was a bit difficult, but it is okay.
[Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) - It was really nice, I like this course, I listened in English with subtitles
