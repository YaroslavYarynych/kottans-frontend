# Hi! 
## My name is Yaroslav. 
I am 20 years old. I am studing in Ivan Franko National University of Lviv.\
I found a lot of buddies and it`s cool. Also I like hiking and riding a bicycling.\
I finished two weeks in coursera and all of the tasks in  learngitbranching.js.\
I learned **HTML5** & **CSS3** before this course, also I started to learn **JS**. I used Git at univercity.\
https://learngitbranching.js.org/ - It is a reaaly good game for students. Last tasks was a bit difficult, but it is okay.\
[Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) - It was really nice, I like this course, I listened in English with subtitles.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

[Module 4](https://github.com/YaroslavYarynych/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/Quiz_4.jpg)\
Linux was new for me at all. It was interesting and I made notes. I was  surprise that hard disks are connect to themself (it is not like Windows). \
Also every quiz were cool. I think I will use Linux in future, I like it.\
Articles about HTTP were very interesting too. I knew about difference between HTTP & HTTPS, but I didn't know such a lot information.\
Thank you for this!
